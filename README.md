🚀 The Express Server
A practice project where I built a basic Node.js and Express server, implemented simple CRUD operations, and explored core backend development concepts. This repository is an evolving learning playground, and more features will be added over time.



📂 Project Overview
This project includes:

✅ Basic Express server setup

✅ Routing and middleware

✅ Simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

✅ JSON data handling

✅ Modular route organization

✅ Error handling fundamentals



🛠 Technologies Used
Node.js

Express.js

(Optional) Nodemon – for automatic server restarts during development



📚 Features
Server Initialization: Basic Express server running on a configurable port

Routing: Defined GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes

Middleware: Usage of Express built-in middleware (express.json())

CRUD Operations: Basic in-memory data manipulation

Error Handling: Simple error responses and status codes

Modular Code: Separation of routes and server logic



🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Node.js installed:
node -v
npm -v



Installation
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/iamkapilll/The-Express-Server.git

2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder:
cd The-Express-Server

3️⃣ Install dependencies:
npm install



Running the Server
Start the server in development mode with Nodemon (if installed):
node index.js



📬 API Endpoints
These are example routes you may have implemented. Adjust them as needed:

| Method | Endpoint     | Description             |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| GET    | `/items`     | Get all items           |
| GET    | `/items/:id` | Get a single item by ID |
| POST   | `/items`     | Create a new item       |
| PUT    | `/items/:id` | Update an existing item |
| DELETE | `/items/:id` | Delete an item          |



✨ Upcoming Improvements
This project will be expanded to include:

🗃 Integration with a database (MongoDB)

🔐 Authentication and authorization

🧪 Unit and integration testing

📈 Request validation

📁 Environment configuration using .env

🛡 Error handling improvements
